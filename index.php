     My name is Alex Buck, I am extrememly into sports, music, and fitness. I recently started my journey in the web programming world last summer. I live in Olympia, Washington with my two roommates and my dog, Diggs.

     I started this web development program because I wanted to give myself a better opportunity for job stability. I previously graduated from Central Washington University with a degree in Tourism Management. This was
